# PS-Powershell
Powershell for Production Support

Most of these scripts/functions are written to work with PS version 2.0.  
The customer's environment I work in is update deprived.
I am sure there are other companies slow to update.  
If running PS version 3 or greater , 
I recommend looking to see if a proper cmdlet exists before using one of mine.
